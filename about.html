                                    <h3>Actually this is my public personal confession</h3>
									<p>My name is Michail-Emmanouil Papadimitriou and i am a 90s child. I come from Salamis. A small historic island in the Saronic Gulf of Greece.</p>
									<p>From my school years i was a really active and high competitive person. I had a music education, that led me to give guitar concerts from a young age and finally to become a musician. Furthermore, i had a strong athletic background. I experimented with many sports like martial arts, ping pong, football, handball and canoe kayak. After a good preparation and many sacrifises, i managed to pass school final exams and succeed at the Greek polytechnic university.</p>
									<p>My new role as a higher level student at the department of electrical and computer engineering was definitely a tough era. Due to my financial status, i forced to work full time as a bartender, as long as i was following very demanding courses at the same time. However, through this difficult experience I got valuable lessons and developed virtues such as patience, adaptation, cooperation, compassion and better communication with people. Both customers and colleagues. Alongside i kept my athletic profile. I was swimming at a racing level and in 2019 I won first place in nationals.</p>
									<p>After completing my studies and as a graduate engineer, i started immediately my career with my first relative job. As an electrical engineer my responsibilities were the technical study, solutions and drawings for the electrical parts of ships' ballast water treatment system and scrubber gas cleaning system.It was a unique experience with a lot of beautiful memories.</p>
									<p>Later i was called from the army to fulfil my obligatory duties.</p>
									<p>After this i was ready to restart my career. This time as data analyst. Through self-improvement and technical training i arrived today, ready for new adventures !</p>
